# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this repository is to create new additions to the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers have tested out the application and have recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data. Beta testers will then use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, users will see a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. This update will consist of three new technical features: 
- Retrieve Weather Data
- Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Retrieve Weather Data
A weather database is created by running an API on Open Weather Map and retrieving a 2,000 sets of random latitudes and longitudes. The set is stored in a list of cities, then parsed using JSON format, then converted into a pandas dataframe.
